    Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
    The client, Artemis Financial is a financial guideance advisor, specializing in investment and banking needs for clients all over the globe.
    
    What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?
    The first step that I took to ensuring that the project had proper security was identifying the potential problem areas of the application.  Our code had to ensure that the cipher being used was not only one of low vulnerability but one with additional security measures added in for protecting the financial data of it's clients.
    
    What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?
    Writing the function to convert strings to a hash provided a good amount of challenge for me.  I believe this came from the combination of a complex equation paired with the proper handling of data types.
    
    How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?
    In the future I would spend a greater amount of time on sanitizing various points of the application.  As it stands now, the provided code was just for internal system use but if the company were to ever put their application out into the world for use by users online, the whole system would need heavy input sanitization.
    
    How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
    My order of operations for the project were to refactor first, this would allow me to ensure that any and all vulnerabilites and compiler issues would reflect the updated code.  By refactoring first I was circumventing upcoming issues possibly croping up once doing additional vulnerability tests.
    
    What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?
    I have always learned best from watching someone practice a skill rather than simply reading about it, so I always seek examples of a problem being worked through online in video form.  This usually helps me understand the process, what is being solved, and what further issues could come up.
    
    Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?
I believe that my code here shows a very well streamlined and efficient code base, specifically referring to the refactored code.  Pursuing a highly efficient code will hopefully help with the minimizing of troubleshooting if you find that future revisions of the code have new vulnerabilities or throw errors.
